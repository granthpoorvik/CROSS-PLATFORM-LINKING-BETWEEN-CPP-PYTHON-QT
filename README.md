## Introduction

Cross-platform linking between C++, Python, and Qt poses challenges but can be achieved with appropriate approaches. Pybind11 facilitates C++ and Python integration, allowing C++ code exposure as Python modules. Qt provides strong C++ support, enabling seamless integration with its libraries. PyQt and PySide aid Qt and Python integration, utilizing Qt's UI capabilities within Python. Developers must handle platform-specific dependencies, ensuring required libraries are managed during build and deployment. Configuring a build system like CMake correctly is vital for proper compilation and generating platform-specific binaries. API and language compatibility must be maintained to facilitate smooth communication between components. With diligent consideration and leveraging available tools, developers can create unified, cross-platform applications that run seamlessly across different operating systems, providing users with a consistent experience. This integration opens doors for versatile applications with powerful UIs and system-level capabilities.

## Technologies Used
 -  Visual Studio IDE
-  pybind11
-  cpp
-  python
-  qt application 
- open3d
- numpy python package


### Getting Started

To get the project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. ###	Install Visual Studio:
-	Download and install Visual Studio from the official Microsoft website.
-	Choose the appropriate version based on your operating system and requirements.

2. ### Installation steps



#  Pip installations :-
python packages
In terminal 
```cmd
pip install open3d  
pip install numpy
```

# for cpp in visual studio :-through vcpkg
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
./vcpkg integrate install
vcpkg install pybind11:x64-windows
```




 ## Configuration details



1. After  completing the  above steps
2. > In Visual studio code
Under project
	>> Select project_name -> Properties->

# some (alternative) steps:
## To directly run the project use the file `final_cross_compiler` which is listed above in repo
## for input files use the file `input_files`
### for source ,target and trans_int_elements field in gui use `input_files`

## Output 
### final_cross_compiler.ui
